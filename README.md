This repository (version 2) contains the relevant data, scripts, and figures for the APL Machine Learning publication "Mixture density networks as a probabilistic surrogate for cycle-to-cycle variability in filamentary HfOx-memristive devices".

**Note**: This is the revised publication version using the raw dataset without outlier removal.

## Main Scripts

1. **training_and_validation.py** – Training and validation script. Specify the number of training samples to train the MDNs.
2. **predictions_for_testset.py** – Uses trained models to predict the probability density function of conductance distributions for test data.
3. **evaluate_predictions_crps.py** – Computes CRPS for all models.
4. **compute_r_squared.py** – Computes R² for all models.
5. **compute_specific_predictions_new_split.py** – Generates specific prediction examples for comparison in main figures.
6. **MDN.py, MDN_loss.py, MDN_predict.py** – Helper functions for training and prediction.
